# BPJT-6-Computer-This-Assignment
Complete the _Compute This_ Assignment in [Lesson 6](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IrxaMRZ1eF9JFtpkh9LUAaQPn2J_q0D7/view?usp=sharing) in [BPJT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1khkhu3q0Rbj6VumUkwz1lBz6oSWMF_XH/view?usp=sharing). 

Create a new file called Tester.java. The main method of Tester should calculate the value of the following formulas and present the answers as shown.

d1 = 3πsin(187°) + |cos(122°)| ...Remember that the arguments of sin and cos must be in radians.

d2 = (14.72)^3.801 + ln 72 ...ln means log base e

The output of your code should appear as follows:

d1 = -0.618672237585067

d2 = 27496.988867001543

Hint 1: Define d1 and d2 so that your code is easier to read

Hint 2: Use Math.toRadians() before using the sin and cos methods
